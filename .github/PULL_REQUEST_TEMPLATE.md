When submitting a pull request, make sure you do the following:
<!--  (check with "x") -->

- [ ] submit the PR to the `development` branch on the main repo, **not** the `master` branch
- [ ] in the header, reference the issue that it closes by number in the format `EWE-0000.`
- [ ] include an imperative description what the PR is for in the subject
- [ ] in the body, explain what the PR addresses
- [ ] do not squash multiple commits into one. We will squash them before we merge the PR

Please ensure you have followed the guidelines outlined in the docs: https://github.kdc.capitalone.com/ease-ui/ease-web-v2/blob/development/CONTRIBUTING.md
