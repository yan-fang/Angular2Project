Please follow Calendar documentation for more\n\t * robust details.\n\t *\n\t * @usage\n\t * ```html\n\t * <input\n\t *  ease-calendar-popup\n\t *  ng-model=\"vm.dt\"\n\t *  is-open = \"vm.isOpen\"\n\t *  calendar-options=\"vm.inlineOptions\">\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * @param {expression} is-open false to hide / true to display the popup. This attribute needs to be on your element.\n\t * @param {object} calendar-object exactly similar to inline calendar except one additional\n\t * property `placement` that gives you ability to specify where you want to place the popup.\n\t * Possible values for placement could be\n\t * 'top-center', 'top-left', 'top-right', 'bottom-center', 'bottom-left', 'bottom-right'. Adding 'auto',\n\t * like `auto top-center` would delegate smart positioning meaning popup/calendar will be positioned based on available\n\t * dimensions.\n\t * @param {Number=} gutter This property is also part of calendar object. Give appropiate value based on your\n\t * base element height. This only used in case you want to align the popup with your input field.\n\t *\n\t * @example\n\t * <example name=\"ease-calendar-popup\" module=\"easeCalendarPopupExample\">\n\t *   <file name=\"easeCalendarPopupExample.js\">\n\t *       angular.module('easeCalendarPopupExample', ['easeUIComponents'])\n\t *         .controller('CalendarDemoCtrl', function($scope) {\n\t *           var self = this;\n\t *           this.dt = new Date();\n\t *           moment.locale('en');\n\t *           this.isOpen = false;\n\t *           this.open = function() {\n\t *            this.isOpen = true;\n\t *           };\n\t *           this.inlineOptions = {\n\t *             format_day_title: 'MMMM YYYY',\n\t *             placement: 'bottom-center',\n\t *             calendar_format: 'MMM, DD YYYY',\n\t *             min_date: new Date('01/01/2016'),\n\t *             max_date: new Date('12/01/2016'),\n\t *             customClass: function (data) {\n\t *              var myDueDate = new Date('September 14, 2016').setHours(0,0,0,0);\n\t *              if(data.date == myDueDate) {\n\t *                return {cssClass: 'due-day', subLabel: 'DUE'};\n\t *              } else {\n\t *                return {cssClass: '', subLabel: ''};\n\t *              }\n\t *             }\n\t *           };\n\t *         })\n\t *   </file>\n\t *   <file name=\"style.css\">\n\t *       .date-input {\n\t *        height: 40px;\n\t *        width: 500px;\n\t *        margin: 50px;\n\t *       }\n\t *   </file>\n\t *   <file name=\"index.html\">\n\t *     <p>Input tag is not implemented as a part of ease-calendar-popup here.

It takes a date and an object JSON containing options for your\n\t * calendar configuration. Please refer to the table below.\n\t * ease-calendar has momentJS as external dependency and for your i18n needs, please refer the http://momentjs.com/docs/#/i18n/changing-locale/ to configure momentjs.\n\t * @param {expression=} customClass function that helps you decorate any date in calendar month. Should return an object\n\t * that represents CSS class name related to current date and the label/text if any that you want to display below the date.\n\t * This function should return an object with foloowing json {cssClass: '', subLable: ''}.\n\t * @param {expression=} isDateDisabled function that gives you control over what to disable in given calendar month\n\t * @param {string=} calendar_format This follows momentjs format. Default is YYYY-MM-DD\n\t * @param {string=} format_day_title This format changes the calendar title that you want to display. Default is MMMM YYYY\n\t * @param {Date} min_date minimum available date in calendar. This has two way binding so if you update min_date, changes\n\t * should be reflected in calendar.\n\t * @param {Date} max_date maximum available date in calendar. You will not be able to navigate after that date.\n\t * @param {Date=} starting_date Use this property to programatically set the active/starting date in calendar.\n\t * @param {object=} staticContent Object used to extract your i18n string tokens. Must include properties such as\n\t * start_day_label, end_day_label, today_label\n\t * @usage\n\t * ```html\n\t * <ease-calendar\n\t *  ng-model=\"vm.dt\"\n\t *  calendar-options=\"vm.inlineOptions\"\n\t * />\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * customClass function gets the input object that holds a current date in month and boolean property selected. true if the\n\t * date is selected so that you can change the label on run time.\n\t * ```js\n\t * @param {Object} day object with date and weather it is selected or not\n\t * @return {Object} Object containing cssClass and subLabel property\n\t * function customClass(day) {\n\t *   var dayFromCalendar = new Date(day.date).setHours(0,0,0,0)\n\t *   var yourDueDate = new Date('July 22, 2016')\n\t *   if(dayFromCalendar == yourDueDate) {\n\t *     return {cssClass: 'due-day', subLabel: 'DUE' } //Label can be anything.

This is mandatory.\n\t *     return { cssClass: '', subLabel: '' }\n\t *   }\n\t * }\n\t *```\n\t * isDateDisabled has the same api except instead of getting an object, you only get date from calendar\n\t * ```js\n\t * // @param {Date} date object\n\t * // @return {boolean} true if you want to disable the given date, false otherwise.\n\t * function isDateDisable(date_) {\n\t *   // e.g you want to block July 24\n\t *   var dayToBlock = new Date('July 24, 2016').setHours(0,0,0,0)\n\t *   var currentDateFromCalendar = new Date(date_).setHours(0,0,0,0)\n\t *   //YOUR LOGIC FOR DISABLE DATES IN CALENDAR MONTH'\n\t *   if(dayToBlock == currentDateFromCalendar) {\n\t *     return true\n\t *   }\n\t * }\n\t *```\n\t *\n\t * @example\n\t * <example name=\"ease-calendar\" module=\"easeCalendarExample\">\n\t *   <file name=\"calendar.js\">\n\t *       angular.module('easeCalendarExample', ['easeUIComponents'])\n\t *         .controller('CalendarDemoCtrl', function($scope) {\n\t *           var vm = this\n\t *           // Please DO IGNORE THIS FUNCTION.

@module easeRangeCalendar(With Range)\n\t *\n\t * @description\n\t * This component displays calendar with ability to select multiple dates. It takes an object JSON containing properties\n\t * for your calendar (same as base inline calendar). The only difference\n\t * to base calendar is the addition of an attribute 'multiple-selection' that adds the\n\t * ability to pass an array to calendar component to retrive user selected dates.\n\t * The first element of an array is your start and second is your end date. Remainer is the range between these two\n\t * dates.\n\t *\n\t * @usage\n\t * ```html\n\t * <ease-calendar\n\t *  ng-model=\"vm.dt\"\n\t *  calendar-options=\"vm.inlineOptions\"\n\t *  multiple-selection = \"vm.selectedDates\"\n\t * />\n\t * ```\n\t * @example\n\t * <example name=\"rangeCalendarDemo\" module=\"rangeCalendarDemo\">\n\t *   <file name=\"index.html\">\n\t *     <div ng-controller=\"RangeCalendarCtrl as vm\" style=\"width: 300px; margin-left: 40%;\">\n\t *        <pre> Selected Dates:- {{vm.multipleSelection}} </pre>\n\t *        <h3> Start Date:- {{vm.startDate | date:'fullDate'}} </h3>\n\t *        <h3> End Date:- {{vm.endDate | date:'fullDate' }} </h3>\n\t *        <ease-calendar\n\t *          class = \"calendar-container\"\n\t *          ng-model=\"vm.dt\"\n\t *          calendar-options=\"vm.inlineOptions\"\n\t *          multiple-selection = \"vm.multipleSelection\"\n\t *        />\n\t *     </div>\n\t *   </file>\n\t *   <file name=\"rangeCalendarDemo.js\">\n\t *     angular.module('rangeCalendarDemo', ['easeCalendar'])\n\t *       .controller('RangeCalendarCtrl', function($scope) {\n\t *          var vm = this\n\t *          this.dt = this.dt = null\n\t *          moment.locale('en')\n\t *          this.inlineOptions = {\n\t *            format_day_title: \"MMMM, YYYY\",\n\t *            min_date: new Date('01/01/2016'),\n\t *            max_date: new Date('12/12/2016')\n\t *          }\n\t *          this.multipleSelection = []\n\t *          this.startDate = null\n\t *          this.endDate = null\n\t *\n\t *          $scope.$watchCollection('vm.multipleSelection', function(newValue) {\n\t *            if(newValue.length > 1) {\n\t *              vm.startDate = new Date(newValue[0])\n\t *              vm.endDate = new Date(newValue[1])\n\t *            }\n\t *          })\n\t *        })\n\t *   </file>\n\t * </example>\n\t *\n\t */\n\t/* @ngInject */\n\texports.default = function ($provide, $injector) {\n\t    var easeCalendarDelegate = function easeCalendarDelegate($delegate) {\n\t        var directive = $delegate[0];\n\t        directive.compile = function () {\n\t            return function (scope, element, attrs, ctrls) {\n\t                if (!attrs.multipleSelection) return;\n\t                var calendarCtrl = ctrls[0];\n\t                var ngModelCtrl = ctrls[1];\n\t                calendarCtrl.selectedDates = [];\n\t                scope.$parent.$watchCollection(attrs.multipleSelection, function (newVal) {\n\t                    calendarCtrl.selectedDates = newVal;\n\t                });\n\t                ngModelCtrl.$viewChangeListeners.push(function () {\n\t                    var newVal = scope.$parent.$eval(attrs.ngModel);\n\t                    var dateVal = newVal.getTime();\n\t                    var selectedDates = calendarCtrl.selectedDates;\n\t                    if (!selectedDates.length || selectedDates.length > 1) {\n\t                        return selectedDates.splice(0, selectedDates.length, dateVal);\n\t                    }\n\t                    selectedDates.push(dateVal);\n\t                    var tempVal = Math.min.apply(null, selectedDates);\n\t                    var maxVal = Math.max.apply(null, selectedDates);\n\t                    tempVal = new Date(tempVal).setHours(24);\n\t                    while (tempVal < maxVal) {\n\t                        selectedDates.push(tempVal);\n\t                        tempVal = new Date(tempVal).setHours(24);\n\t                    }\n\t                });\n\t                scope.$watch(function () {\n\t                    return calendarCtrl.activeDate.getTime();\n\t                }, update);\n\t                // [FIXME] [SD] This is as bad as it gets...\n\t                scope.$watch(function () {\n\t                    return calendarCtrl.selectedDay;\n\t                }, update);\n\t                scope.$watch(calendarCtrl.selectedDates, update);\n\t                function buildDayObject(current, start, day, end) {\n\t                    var isStaticContent = angular.isUndefined(calendarCtrl.staticContent);\n\t                    var startDayLabel = isStaticContent ?

Also give role=\"application\" to the partent.\n\t * The easeProfilePicture component is renderring the circle to display the final cropped result image and also to trigger the new image file selection.\n\t * @usage\n\t * ```html\n\t *  <ease-image-crop image=\"newImageData\" result-image=\"currentImageData\" data-ng-class = \"loadingClass\"></ease-image-crop>\n\t *  <ease-profile-picture new-image-data = \"newImageData\" current-image-data = \"currentImageData\" loading-class = \"loadingClass\"></ease-profile-picture>\n\t * ```\n\t * @param {string} image This is used in the easeImageCrop directive in order to receive the image to start the cropping.\n\t * @param {string} resultImage This is used in the easeImageCrop directive in order to give back the cropped result image.\n\t * @param {string} newImageData This is used in the easeProfilePicture component in order to give new selected image to the cropping area.\n\t * @param {string} currentImageData This is used in the easeProfilePicture component in order to display current image and also receive new cropped image.\n\t * @param {string} loadingClass This is to make the cropping area (easeImageCrop directive) dynamicallly show the image loading CSS effect.\n\t *\n\t * @example\n\t * <example name=\"ease-image-crop\" module=\"cropImageExample\">\n\t *   <file name=\"script.js\">\n\t *     angular.module('cropImageExample', ['easeUIComponents'])\n\t *       .controller('Ctrl', [\"$scope\", function ($scope) {\n\t *         $scope.newImageData = ''\n\t *         $scope.currentImageData = 'profileIcon.png'\n\t *         $scope.loadingClass = ''\n\t *       }])\n\t *   </file>\n\t *   <file name=\"index.html\">\n\t *     <script src=\"script.js\"></script>\n\t *     <style type=\"text/css\">\n\t *      .cropArea {\n\t *        width: 400px;\n\t *        height: 300px;\n\t *        margin: auto;\n\t *        top: 150px;\n\t *        position: absolute;\n\t *        left: 50px;\n\t *      }\n\t *      .profilePictureCircle {\n\t *        position: absolute;\n\t *        left: 50px;\n\t *      }\n\t *     </style>\n\t *     <div ng-controller=\"Ctrl\">\n\t *      <div class=\"profilePictureCircle\">\n\t *        <ease-profile-picture new-image-data = \"newImageData\" current-image-data = \"currentImageData\" loading-class = \"loadingClass\"></ease-profile-picture>\n\t *      </div>\n\t *      <div class=\"cropArea\" role=\"application\">\n\t *        <ease-image-crop tabindex = \"0\" role=\"region\" aria-describedby=\"imageCropGuide\" image=\"newImageData\" result-image=\"currentImageData\" data-ng-class = \"loadingClass\">\n\t *        </ease-image-crop>\n\t *      </div>\n\t *   </div>\n\t *   </file>\n\t * </example>\n\t */\n\texports.default = angular.module('easeImageCrop', []).directive('easeImageCrop', _easeImageCrop2.default);\n\n/***/ },\n/* 51 */\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\t'use strict';\n\t\n\tObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", {\n\t    value: true\n\t});\n\t\n\tvar _easeImageCrop = __webpack_require__(52);\n\t\n\tvar _easeImageCrop2 = _interopRequireDefault(_easeImageCrop);\n\t\n\t__webpack_require__(59);\n\t\n\tfunction _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ?

The\n\t  primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n\t  registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the reason\n\t  why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\t\n\t  Terminology\n\t  -----------\n\t\n\t  - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n\t  - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n\t  - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n\t  - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n\t  - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n\t  - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n\t\n\t  A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n\t\n\t  Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n\t  state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n\t  rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n\t\n\t  Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n\t  promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n\t  settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n\t  itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n\t  itself fulfill.\n\t\n\t\n\t  Basic Usage:\n\t  ------------\n\t\n\t  ```js\n\t  let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n\t    // on success\n\t    resolve(value);\n\t\n\t    // on failure\n\t    reject(reason);\n\t  });\n\t\n\t  promise.then(function(value) {\n\t    // on fulfillment\n\t  }, function(reason) {\n\t    // on rejection\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t\n\t  Advanced Usage:\n\t  ---------------\n\t\n\t  Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n\t  `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n\t\n\t  ```js\n\t  function getJSON(url) {\n\t    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n\t      let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\t\n\t      xhr.open('GET', url);\n\t      xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n\t      xhr.responseType = 'json';\n\t      xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n\t      xhr.send();\n\t\n\t      function handler() {\n\t        if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n\t          if (this.status === 200) {\n\t            resolve(this.response);\n\t          } else {\n\t            reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n\t          }\n\t        }\n\t      };\n\t    });\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n\t    // on fulfillment\n\t  }, function(reason) {\n\t    // on rejection\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t\n\t  Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n\t\n\t  ```js\n\t  Promise.all([\n\t    getJSON('/posts'),\n\t    getJSON('/comments')\n\t  ]).then(function(values){\n\t    values[0] // => postsJSON\n\t    values[1] // => commentsJSON\n\t\n\t    return values;\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t\n\t  @class Promise\n\t  @param {function} resolver\n\t  Useful for tooling.\n\t  @constructor\n\t*/\n\tfunction Promise(resolver) {\n\t  this[PROMISE_ID] = nextId();\n\t  this._result = this._state = undefined;\n\t  this._subscribers = [];\n\t\n\t  if (noop !== resolver) {\n\t    typeof resolver !== 'function' && needsResolver();\n\t    this instanceof Promise ? initializePromise(this, resolver) : needsNew();\n\t  }\n\t}\n\t\n\tPromise.all = all;\n\tPromise.race = race;\n\tPromise.resolve = resolve;\n\tPromise.reject = reject;\n\tPromise._setScheduler = setScheduler;\n\tPromise._setAsap = setAsap;\n\tPromise._asap = asap;\n\t\n\tPromise.prototype = {\n\t  constructor: Promise,\n\t\n\t  /**\n\t    The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n\t    which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n\t    reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\t  \n\t    ```js\n\t    findUser().then(function(user){\n\t      // user is available\n\t    }, function(reason){\n\t      // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    Chaining\n\t    --------\n\t  \n\t    The return value of `then` is itself a promise.  This second, 'downstream'\n\t    promise is resolved with the return value of the first promise's fulfillment\n\t    or rejection handler, or rejected if the handler throws an exception.\n\t  \n\t    ```js\n\t    findUser().then(function (user) {\n\t      return user.name;\n\t    }, function (reason) {\n\t      return 'default name';\n\t    }).then(function (userName) {\n\t      // If `findUser` fulfilled, `userName` will be the user's name, otherwise it\n\t      // will be `'default name'`\n\t    });\n\t  \n\t    findUser().then(function (user) {\n\t      throw new Error('Found user, but still unhappy');\n\t    }, function (reason) {\n\t      throw new Error('`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy');\n\t    }).then(function (value) {\n\t      // never reached\n\t    }, function (reason) {\n\t      // if `findUser` fulfilled, `reason` will be 'Found user, but still unhappy'.\n\t      // If `findUser` rejected, `reason` will be '`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy'.\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t    If the downstream promise does not specify a rejection handler, rejection reasons will be propagated further downstream.\n\t  \n\t    ```js\n\t    findUser().then(function (user) {\n\t      throw new PedagogicalException('Upstream error');\n\t    }).then(function (value) {\n\t      // never reached\n\t    }).then(function (value) {\n\t      // never reached\n\t    }, function (reason) {\n\t      // The `PedgagocialException` is propagated all the way down to here\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    Assimilation\n\t    ------------\n\t  \n\t    Sometimes the value you want to propagate to a downstream promise can only be\n\t    retrieved asynchronously. This can be achieved by returning a promise in the\n\t    fulfillment or rejection handler. The downstream promise will then be pending\n\t    until the returned promise is settled. This is called *assimilation*.\n\t  \n\t    ```js\n\t    findUser().then(function (user) {\n\t      return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n\t    }).then(function (comments) {\n\t      // The user's comments are now available\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    If the assimliated promise rejects, then the downstream promise will also reject.\n\t  \n\t    ```js\n\t    findUser().then(function (user) {\n\t      return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n\t    }).then(function (comments) {\n\t      // If `findCommentsByAuthor` fulfills, we'll have the value here\n\t    }, function (reason) {\n\t      // If `findCommentsByAuthor` rejects, we'll have the reason here\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    Simple Example\n\t    --------------\n\t  \n\t    Synchronous Example\n\t  \n\t    ```javascript\n\t    let result;\n\t  \n\t    try {\n\t      result = findResult();\n\t      // success\n\t    } catch(reason) {\n\t      // failure\n\t    }\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    Errback Example\n\t  \n\t    ```js\n\t    findResult(function(result, err){\n\t      if (err) {\n\t        // failure\n\t      } else {\n\t        // success\n\t      }\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    Promise Example;\n\t  \n\t    ```javascript\n\t    findResult().then(function(result){\n\t      // success\n\t    }, function(reason){\n\t      // failure\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    Advanced Example\n\t    --------------\n\t  \n\t    Synchronous Example\n\t  \n\t    ```javascript\n\t    let author, books;\n\t  \n\t    try {\n\t      author = findAuthor();\n\t      books  = findBooksByAuthor(author);\n\t      // success\n\t    } catch(reason) {\n\t      // failure\n\t    }\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    Errback Example\n\t  \n\t    ```js\n\t  \n\t    function foundBooks(books) {\n\t  \n\t    }\n\t  \n\t    function failure(reason) {\n\t  \n\t    }\n\t  \n\t    findAuthor(function(author, err){\n\t      if (err) {\n\t        failure(err);\n\t        // failure\n\t      } else {\n\t        try {\n\t          findBoooksByAuthor(author, function(books, err) {\n\t            if (err) {\n\t              failure(err);\n\t            } else {\n\t              try {\n\t                foundBooks(books);\n\t              } catch(reason) {\n\t                failure(reason);\n\t              }\n\t            }\n\t          });\n\t        } catch(error) {\n\t          failure(err);\n\t        }\n\t        // success\n\t      }\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    Promise Example;\n\t  \n\t    ```javascript\n\t    findAuthor().\n\t      then(findBooksByAuthor).\n\t      then(function(books){\n\t        // found books\n\t    }).catch(function(reason){\n\t      // something went wrong\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    @method then\n\t    @param {Function} onFulfilled\n\t    @param {Function} onRejected\n\t    Useful for tooling.\n\t    @return {Promise}\n\t  */\n\t  then: then,\n\t\n\t  /**\n\t    `catch` is simply sugar for `then(undefined, onRejection)` which makes it the same\n\t    as the catch block of a try/catch statement.\n\t  \n\t    ```js\n\t    function findAuthor(){\n\t      throw new Error('couldn't find that author');\n\t    }\n\t  \n\t    // synchronous\n\t    try {\n\t      findAuthor();\n\t    } catch(reason) {\n\t      // something went wrong\n\t    }\n\t  \n\t    // async with promises\n\t    findAuthor().catch(function(reason){\n\t      // something went wrong\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    @method catch\n\t    @param {Function} onRejection\n\t    Useful for tooling.\n\t    @return {Promise}\n\t  */\n\t  'catch': function _catch(onRejection) {\n\t    return this.then(null, onRejection);\n\t  }\n\t};\n\t\n\tfunction polyfill() {\n\t    var local = undefined;\n\t\n\t    if (typeof global !== 'undefined') {\n\t        local = global;\n\t    } else if (typeof self !== 'undefined') {\n\t        local = self;\n\t    } else {\n\t        try {\n\t            local = Function('return this')();\n\t        } catch (e) {\n\t            throw new Error('polyfill failed because global object is unavailable in this environment');\n\t        }\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    var P = local.Promise;\n\t\n\t    if (P) {\n\t        var promiseToString = null;\n\t        try {\n\t            promiseToString = Object.prototype.toString.call(P.resolve());\n\t        } catch (e) {\n\t            // silently ignored\n\t        }\n\t\n\t        if (promiseToString === '[object Promise]' && !P.cast) {\n\t            return;\n\t        }\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    local.Promise = Promise;\n\t}\n\t\n\tpolyfill();\n\t// Strange compat..\n\tPromise.polyfill = polyfill;\n\tPromise.Promise = Promise;\n\t\n\treturn Promise;\n\t\n\t})));\n\t//# sourceMappingURL=es6-promise.map\n\t/* WEBPACK VAR INJECTION */}.call(exports, __webpack_require__(65), (function() { return this;

In the method that will open the modal, use the easeUIModalService.showModal method. Pass an object containing the name of\n\t  * the controller to use in the modal (controller) and the path to the HTML file for the modal (templateUrl) as the parameter for the\n\t  * showModal method. If a controller is not passed in, the modal will use the default controller provided in easeUIModalService, which\n\t  * contains only the close() method. If you need to pass data into the modal, you can include an object with the data defined (inputs).\n\t  * Lastly, you must make sure to include the resolution for the promise (see usage code for reference).\n\t  *\n\t  * 3.) In the controller for the modal, add 'close' as a dependency. You must include $scope.close = close in the controller in order\n\t  * for the modal to close correctly. If data needs to be passed back, it can be included in a result object that is then used\n\t  * as a parameter in the close function (i.e. close($scope.result)). If data has been passed in using the inputs object, you will have\n\t  * to add the name of the input as a dependency in the modal controller in order to reference it. For an example where data is being\n\t  * passed to and from modals, please see the code for the results and confirm modals below.\n\t  *\n\t  * 4.) In the HTML file for the modal, wrap the desired contents of the modal inside the <ease-ui-modal> tag, with the required\n\t  * inputs.\n\t  *\n\t  * @usage\n\t  * ```html\n\t  * <ease-ui-modal close-modal=\"close()\" modal-id=\"'modalExample'\" modal-title=\"'Your Modal Title'\">\n\t  *   Your modal content here\n\t  * </ease-ui-modal>\n\t  * ```\n\t  * ```js\n\t  * easeUIModalService.showModal({\n\t  *   templateUrl: 'path/to/file.html',\n\t  *   controller: controllerForModal\n\t  * }).then(function(modal) {\n\t  *   modal.close.then(function(result) {\n\t  *     // code to handle result object\n\t  *   })\n\t  * })\n\t  * ```\n\t  *\n\t  * @param {function} closeModal Function that triggers when user closes the modal.\n\t  * @param {string} modalId ID value for modal close button. It will be appended to 'closeModal_' (i.e. closeModal_modalExample).\n\t  * @param {string} modalTitle Title to display above the modal content.\n\t  * @param {string} [loopTarget=\".ease-modal-close-button\"] CSS selector string for override element to be targeted when looping through the modal.\n\t  * @param {string} [modalRole=dialog] Set the role of the modal to use for accessibility tools.\n\t  * @param {boolean} [doubleWide=false] Determines if modal should be shown as double width on desktop view.\n\t  * @param {boolean} [fullScreen=false] Determines if modal should be full screen on desktop view.\n\t  * @param {boolean} [showIconMobile=false] Determines if icon should be shown in mobile view.\n\t  *\n\t  * @example\n\t  * <example name=\"modal\"

@name easeUiDropdown\n\t * @module easeUiDropdown\n\t * @description\n\t * This component is the extension for ease-ui-dropdown-menu.\n\t * Out of the box this component will provide following features:\n\t *\n\t * 1. Toggle the dropdown menu.\n\t * 2. Display the last selected option.\n\t * 3. Filter from the dropdown menu list.\n\t * 4. Ability to choose data-point for filter.\n\t * 5. Set default select value.\n\t * 6. Enable or disable the ease-ui-dropdown-menu list filter.\n\t * 7. Supports all the combobox key-navigation funcations.\n\t *\n\t *\n\t * Accessibility requirement:\n\t *\n\t * Please give role=\"application\" to the immediate parent tag of <ease-ui-dropdown> for JAWs to work properly\n\t *\n\t *\n\t * FAQ\n\t *\n\t * Q: Which attribute should I use to pass the data to the ease-ui-dropdown component?\n\t * A: Persist-items attribute should be used for passing data to the ease-ui-dropdown component.\n\t *\n\t * Q: Do I need to use the ease-ui-dropdown-menu component in ease-ui-dropdown?\n\t * A: Yes, ease-ui-dropdown-menu renders all the list items.\n\t *\n\t * Q: Do I need to supply items array to ease-ui-dropdown component?\n\t * A: No. Ease-ui-dropdown will internally generate items array from persist-items.  However, the consumer must provide\n\t *    one controller variable to synchronize the three places (vm.items) in the sample code of the below Usage part.\n\t *\n\t * Q: Why do you need is-open? Is is required all the time?\n\t * A: This attribute will bind the toggle feature for the dropdown menu. Absolutely required.\n\t *\n\t * Q: Why do you have data-index `{`{$index}`}`?\n\t * A: Interesting question. It is required to provide the index to track the click event for li element.\n\t *\n\t * Q: what is role = \"option\" doing in example with template?\n\t * A: It makes your template accessible.\n\t *\n\t * Q: How do I set the preselect value?\n\t * A: Predefining the model-value, secondary-data and tertiary-data attribute will set the preselect value for the input field.\n\t *\n\t * Q: Why does drop-down not render my updated array items?\n\t * A: Array should be contained in object. eg.: list = {items:[{},{},{}]}\n\t *\n\t * Q: Why do I see one critical aXe scan defect: Required ARIA child role not present: textbox\n\t * A: This is an known open issue with the aXe tool and we already talk with accessibility team. The action is to leave it for now.\n\t *\n\t *\n\t * @usage\n\t * Note: Ignore ` symbols in angular expression.\n\t * ```html\n\t *  <ease-ui-dropdown\n\t *          is-open = \"vm.isOpen\"\n\t *          persist-items = \"vm.itemsPersist\"\n\t *          items = \"vm.items\"\n\t *          model-value = \"vm.selectedItem\"\n\t *          filter-by = \"label\"\n\t *          required = vm.required\n\t *          disable-search = \"false\"\n\t *          select = \"vm.selected(item)\"\n\t *          combobox = \"vm.data\"\n\t *        >\n\t *        <ease-ui-dropdown-menu\n\t *            select = \"vm.selected(item)\"\n\t *            items = \"vm.items\"\n\t *            template = true\n\t *            is-open = \"vm.isOpen\"\n\t *            component-id = \"`{`{vm.data.id`}`}\"\n\t *          >\n\t *          <li data-ng-repeat = \"item in vm.items\"\n\t *              data-index = `{`{$index}`}`\n\t *              role = \"option\"\n\t *              tabindex= \"-1\"\n\t *              id = \"search-amount-option-`{`{$index}`}`\"\n\t *            >\n\t *              <span class=\"ease-itemlabel\" id = \"search-amount-option-`{`{$index}`}`-label\">{{item.label}}</span>\n\t *              <span class=\"ease-itemSubLabel\">{{item.subLabel}}</span>\n\t *              <span class=\"ease-item-amount\">{{item.amount}}</span>\n\t *            </li>\n\t *          </ease-ui-dropdown-menu>\n\t *   </ease-ui-dropdown>\n\t *\n\t * ```\n\t * @param {Boolean} is-open This controls show/hide dropdown.\n\t * @param {Array} persist-items Original data source list passed by the consumer.\n\t * @param {Array} items The items display in the drop down menu list and it is subset of persist-items.\n\t * @param {String} model-value This variable holds ng-model value.\n\t * @param {String=} filter-by This is the object property name provided by end user for multi data-point list.

component which draws extensibility bar based on user's input data. As of\n\t * now extensiblityBar can display four main menus on it. On tab, extensiblityBar will show menus 1,2 and 4. On Mobile device\n\t * extensibility bar will show  menu 4 or compressed menus 1,3,4 depending on 'mobile-column' flag and on desktop view all 4\n\t * options will be avilabel.\n\t * One can as well pass more than four menus to the extensibility bar and mark them invisible by using\n\t * ng-show attribute. Pleaes refer to example below for more information.\n\t *\n\t * easeExtensibilityBar component can as well render more account services in modal, if data for it is provided. This data will\n\t * be displayed in 3 by n matrix by default. 'menu-attrs' attribute allows to pass valid html\n\t * tags to the component including angular specific once like ng-show, ng-class etc. Please refer\n\t * to below example for more details.\n\t * If out of the box implementation for more account services is not desired,\n\t * user can provide custom template through 'modal-template-url' attributeto of the directive which will get rendered inside modal.\n\t * This template will have the same scope as that of the modal-controller.\n\t *\n\t * FAQ\n\t *\n\t *\n\t * How can I address tleaf requirments ?\n\t *\n\t * to set id or any other attribute , just pass it on in attrs array as  {key: 'id', val:'someValue'}.\n\t *\n\t * =============================================================\n\t *\n\t * How sitecatalyst requirments are being addressed ?\n\t *\n\t * you can pass in the following: ```{key:'ng-click', val: 'vm.doSomething()'}``` in the list of attributes.\n\t *\n\t * =============================================================\n\t *\n\t * How can I address accessibility requirments?\n\t *\n\t * you can pass in custom properties through attrs array and those will get applied to the element. e.g. {key: 'aria-label', val:'someValue'}\n\t *\n\t * =============================================================\n\t *\n\t * How to have multi column rendering for mobile view ?\n\t *\n\t * Provide appropriate value for attribute mobile-columns. Value 1 will render one column layout, value 3 will render 3 column layout for mobile.\n\t *\n\t * =============================================================\n\t *\n\t *  What if I want to have different layout for more account services ?\n\t *\n\t * By default more account services will display 3 by 3 matrix to display all menus. If you wish to have\n\t * custom layout, you can provide custom html through attribute \"modalTemplateUrl\" which will get rendered\n\t * inside modal.\n\t *\n\t * =============================================================\n\t *\n\t * @usage\n\t * ```html\n\t *<ease-extensibility-bar content=\"::json\" modal-controller=\"modalController\"  mobile-columns = 3></ease-extensibility-bar>\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * @param {string} modal-controller Name of the controller for handling modal interactions .\n\t * @param {number} mobile-columns Number of columns for mobile view (1 or 3) .\n\t * @param {string} modalTemplateUrl template URL for modal incase \"More Account Services\"layout needs to be overridden .\n\t * @param {string} modal-title Title for  \"More Account Services\" modal .\n\t * @param {function} open-modal-call-back Optional callback for more services modal.

The consumer also\n\t * has the option to set the input box type to phone, email, or date (inputType). The consumer can also pass in a maximum character\n\t * limit (charLimit), the length, in characters, of the input box (length), a method to validate the content of the input box\n\t * (validateInput), and other parameters (see below documentation for more details). All the date error message should follow this object signature static-content = {dateValidationMsg: {invalidDate: '', invalidMaxDate:'', invalidMinDate:''}}\n\t * to prevent from crowding the component with attributes.\n\t *\n\t * FAQ\n\t *\n\t * Q: Why is icon in ease-input field not aligned right inside the input field and will it occur on EASE App after consumption?\n\t *\n\t * A: There is an inconsistency on the occurrence of this issue and it is only occurring on build book example.\n\t *    This issue wasn’t reproducible in EASE App during consumption testing. Development team is doing root cause analysis for this issue and will release a hot-fix based on the solution.\n\t *    In order to get the quickest help, please email #Houston directly.\n\t *\n\t * Q: Why does the error message not read out when using the JAWS screen reader?\n\t *\n\t * A: According to the Accessibility team, there is an issue with JAWS that prevents the error message from being announced\n\t *    to the user. As a result, we have added the aria-describedby attribute so that any present error message will be read out\n\t *    when the user is focused on the input field (as part of the description of the field).\n\t *\n\t * Language Support\n\t *\n\t * Please note this section is only required for EASE consumers: all other consumers are not required to pass the\n\t * staticContent object (though they are welcome to use it to pass customized content to the component).\n\t * If the object is not passed, the component will fall back to default English content.\n\t *\n\t * The input component has been built to handle receiving static content from Nuxeo, in order to support multiple languages.\n\t * This is done via the staticContent parameter, which contains the placeholder, validationMsg, and maxCharMsg keys. These keys\n\t * should have the static content values fetched from Nuxeo. Currently, the available files are in Nuxeo under the EASE/CORE folder,\n\t * and are named 'core_component_forminputs_en_US.properties' (English) and 'core_component_forminputs_es_US.properties' (Spanish).\n\t * It is the consumer's responsibility to pass the correct content, as the component will simply display whatever is passed in the\n\t * staticContent object.\n\t *\n\t * @usage\n\t * ```html\n\t * <ease-input static-content=\"contentObj\" input-id=\"'yourId'\" input-val=\"yourVariable\" label=\"'Label Text'\"\n\t *  input-type=\"'inputType'\" input-status=\"'status'\" char-limit=\"25\" size=\"25\" validate-input=\"validateMethod(content)\"></ease-input>\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * @param {object} staticContent A JSON object containing the placeholder, validationMsg, dateValidationMsg and maxCharMsg properties (obtained from Nuxeo or customized). If no object is provided, the default English content from Nuxeo will be used. Please see the Language Support section above for more information.\n\t * @param {string} inputId The id value used to identify the input box. Note that this must be unique for the page where the component is being consumed.\n\t * @param {variable} inputVal The variable that will be used to store the contents of the input box. If you use the phone, please provide the initial value in this format (xxx) xxx-xxxx\n\t * @param {string} label The text label to be displayed above the input box.\n\t * @param {string} [placeholder=''] String to display if nothing has been entered in the input box. By default, nothing is displayed. For Date please provide MM/DD/YYYY or DD/MM/YYYY. It will be use for date validation and date conversion. NOTE: THIS PARAMETER IS DEPRECATED, PLEASE PASS THIS PARAMETER INSIDE OF THE staticContent OBJECT.\n\t * @param {string} [validationMsg=''] The customized error message to display to the user if the validation of the input fails. Date object signature {invalidDate: '', invalidMaxDate:'', invalidMinDate:''}. NOTE: THIS PARAMETER IS DEPRECATED, PLEASE PASS THIS PARAMETER INSIDE OF THE staticContent OBJECT.\n\t * @param {string} [maxCharMsg=''] Message to display when input reaches maximum character limit. NOTE: THIS PARAMETER IS DEPRECATED, PLEASE PASS THIS PARAMETER INSIDE OF THE staticContent OBJECT.\n\t * @param {integer} [charLimit=null] Max number of characters the user is allowed to enter in the input box. By default, there is no character limit.\n\t * @param {integer} [length=24] Length of input box, in number of characters.\n\t * @param {function} [validateInput=return true] The validation method that is run when the user leaves the input box. The method should take in the content of the input box as a parameter, and return true or false if the content passes or fails validation, respectively. By default, there is no validation on the content.\n\t * @param {string} [inputType=''] Input box type, current options are 'phone', 'email', 'date', or ''. Passing '' or not passing a value will result in a generic input box.\n\t * @param {string} [inputStatus=''] Input box status, locked or primary.\n\t * @param {Boolean} [isRequired='false'] This property sets the input to be required.\n\t * @param {string} [requiredMsg=''] The customized error message for when a required field is left empty after being touched.\n\t * @param {string} [errorStatus=''] External error status set by the user, value could be 'error' or ''. Consumer can pass in the status value to the input box to force error state.\n\t * @param {Boolean} [hasError='false'] Input error status. Consumer can watch this value to track the state of the input.\n\t * @param {string} [errorMsg=''] Input box error status message, consumer pass in the error message.\n\t * @param {string} [max=''] Input date max-date for validation (attribute needed if date validation is required).\n\t * @param {string} [min=''] Input date min-date for validation (attribute needed if date validation is required).\n\t * @param {string} [dateInfo='Today'] extra info for the date if its Today.\n\t * @param {function} [iconClick=''] Input date callback function for calendar click event.\n\t * @param {Boolean} [showIcon='false'] Input date show/hide calander icon. True will show the calander popup icon.\n\t *\n\t *\n\t * @example\n\t * <example name=\"ease-input\" module=\"easeInputExample\">\n\t *   <file name=\"index.html\">\n\t *     <div

* @module easeTooltip\n\t * @description\n\t * Shows a tooltip when inserted into the UI. The tooltip message displayed to the user is controlled by what is passed into the 'tipMessage' variable (the only required param).\n\t *\n\t * Additional attributes can be passed in an options object, like triggerMessage, position, positionAuto, size, and showIcon.\n\t *\n\t * You can also pass in custom attrs as an array of {key: 'attr', value: 'attrValue'} pairs.\n\t *\n\t * Additional details on parameters are detailed below.\n\t *\n\t * FAQ:\n\t * -----------\n\t * How does the positioning work?\n\t *\n\t * Position can be passed in as a string or an object. In conjunction with positionAuto, there are 4 possibilities:\n\t *\n\t * (1) position: string && positionAuto: false - tooltip is statically at that position\n\t *\n\t * (2) position: object && positionAuto: false - tooltip is statically at each position defined in the position object per breakpoint key. The allowed keys are 'desktop', 'tablet', and 'phone'.\n\t *\n\t * For example, given a position object {desktop: 'right', tablet: 'top', phone: 'bottom'}, the tooltip will show to the right at desktop breakpoint, top on tablet, and bottom on phone.\n\t *\n\t * If a given breakpoint is not defined (i.e. if 'phone' were missing in the example), the tooltip will use the default position ('top') at that breakpoint.\n\t *\n\t * (3) position: string && positionAuto: true - tooltip will test if the given position is visible in the current viewport and if so, will use that position. If not, will try alternate positions as described below.\n\t *\n\t * (4) position: object && positionAuto: true - positionAuto isn't meant to be used with a position object. In this case tooltip will convert position to a string equal to the first position value in the object, and then revert to case (3).\n\t *\n\t * =============================================================\n\t *\n\t * How does positionAuto work?\n\t *\n\t * positionAuto tries the given position, and then tries alternate positions in this order:\n\t *\n\t * (1) If tooltip's primary position is along the 'top' or 'bottom':\n\t *\n\t * [position], [position]-left, [position]-right, [opposite side], [opposite site]-left, [opposite side]-right, left, left-top, left-bottom, right, right-top, right-bottom\n\t *\n\t * (2) If tooltip's primary position is along the 'left' or 'right':\n\t *\n\t * [position], [position]-top, [position]-bottom, [opposite side], [opposite site]-top, [opposite side]-bottom, top, top-left, top-right, bottom, bottom-left, bottom-right\n\t *\n\t * After trying all positions, if it still hasn't found 1 that is visible in the current viewport, it will just display the tooltip at the given position.\n\t *\n\t * =============================================================\n\t *\n\t * Can showIcon be false and triggerMessage be empty at the same time?\n\t *\n\t * Technically yes, but then the user won't have anything to hover/click on so doesn't seem advisable. However the tooltip will still appear in the tab order.\n\t *\n\t * =============================================================\n\t *\n\t * How does behavior differ between desktop and tablet/phone?\n\t *\n\t * On desktop, tooltip visibility is triggered by hover and tab. On tablet/phone, it is triggered on tap. Tapping multiple times toggles visibility; tapping away hides the tooltip as well.\n\t *\n\t * =============================================================\n\t *\n\t * Can I have a link in the tooltip?\n\t *\n\t * That's inadvisable as right now elements in the tooltip would not be keyboard-only accessible (through tabbing). If you choose to implement this, you are in charge of making the content properly accessible.\n\t *\n\t * =============================================================\n\t *\n\t * Can I pass in a custom ID/function/etc (i.e. for TeaLeaf or SiteCatalyst)?\n\t *\n\t * Yes, custom attributes are supported. See the \"custom attributes\" example below.\n\t *\n\t * =============================================================\n\t *\n\t * @usage\n\t * ```html\n\t * // default options: would generate an info icon that has the message on hover\n\t * <ease-tooltip tip-message=\"'Your tooltip message goes here'\">\n\t * </ease-tooltip>\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * @param {string} tipMessage Message to be displayed in the tooltip. Can contain code.\n\t * @param {object} [options={attrs: (empty array), position: top, positionAuto: false, size: 'large', showIcon: true, triggerMessage: ''}] Options hash with several expected values. More details on each below.\n\t * @param {array} [options.attrs=(empty array)] Attrs is an array catch-all for other attributes (formatted as {key: 'attr', value: 'attrValue'}) you want to pass in, which will get attached to a container div.\n\t * @param {string/object} [options.position='top'] Can be a string or an object. Available positions are: 'top', 'top-left', 'top-right', 'left', 'left-top', 'left-bottom', 'bottom', 'bottom-left', 'bottom-right', 'right', 'right-top', 'right-bottom'. If an object, can pass in up to 3 positions in {breakpoint: position} format. More info in the FAQ.\n\t * @param {boolean} [options.positionAuto=false] If true, tests if the stated position (if position object passed in, just uses the first position value) is in the viewport, otherwise tries alternate positions, in an order detailed in the FAQ.\n\t * @param {string} [options.size='large'] Size modifiers for the tooltip. 'large' is 300px, 'medium' is 200px, and 'small' is 100px.\n\t * @param {boolean} [options.showIcon=true] If true, shows the info icon and anchors the tooltip carat to it. If false, doesn't show the icon and centers the carat on the triggerMessage.\n\t * @param {string} [options.triggerMessage=''] Text on the page that will also display the tooltip on hover (or click on mobile/tablet). Can contain code.\n\t *\n\t * @example\n\t * <example name=\"easeTooltip\" module=\"easeTooltipDemo\">\n\t *   <file name=\"index.html\">\n\t *     <div class=\"wrapper\"

You will need to fire 'category-selected' event\n\t * when user is done selecting the category item.\n\t * ```js\n\t * // Event structure\n\t * new CustomEvent('category-selected', {\n\t *\n\t *   detail: {value: 'Statement Picker', index: 1}\n\t * })\n\t * // Index points to index of the item being interacted with in your categories array you are passing.\n\t * document.dispatchEvent(event)\n\t * ```\n\t * Also component fires reseting-category-filter when user resets or hits on cancel icon. detail object will contain\n\t * value indicating which filter was being reset and you can act accordingly based on the value.\n\t * ```js\n\t * // Event structure\n\t * new CustomEvent('reseting-category-filter', {\n\t *   detail: {\n\t *     value, index\n\t *   }\n\t * })\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * This component will accept an array of your filter categories.\n\t * Object should have following properties.\n\t * @param {String} key This will be used to identify the object independently\n\t * @param {String} value The value you want to render in the DOM. E.g Custom Date\n\t * @param {Array} options This array contains Option object with following properties\n\t * @param {String} key This will be used to uniquely identify flyout list item.\n\t * @param {String} value This will be used to render the lable on the DOM.\n\t * @param {Function} action This function will be invoked on click of this particular property. Say you want to\n\t * open a Date Range picker or Statement Picker.\n\t *\n\t * @example\n\t * <example name=\"ease-filter-bar\" module=\"easeFilterBarExample\">\n\t *   <file name=\"index.html\">\n\t

dates. It takes an object JSON containing properties\n * for your calendar (same as base inline calendar). The only difference\n * to base calendar is the addition of an attribute 'multiple-selection' that adds the\n * ability to pass an array to calendar component to retrive user selected dates.\n * The first element of an array is your start and second is your end date. Remainer is the range between these two\n * dates.\n *\n * @usage\n * ```html\n * <ease-calendar\n *  ng-model=\"vm.dt\"\n *  calendar-options=\"vm.inlineOptions\"\n *  multiple-selection = \"vm.selectedDates\"\n * />\n * ```\n * @example\n * <example name=\"rangeCalendarDemo\" module=\"rangeCalendarDemo\">\n *   <file name=\"index.html\">\n *     <div ng-controller=\"RangeCalendarCtrl as vm\" style=\"width: 300px; margin-left: 40%;\">\n *        <pre> Selected Dates:- {{vm.multipleSelection}} </pre>\n *        <h3> Start Date:- {{vm.startDate | date:'fullDate'}} </h3>\n *        <h3> End Date:- {{vm.endDate | date:'fullDate' }} </h3>\n *        <ease-calendar\n *          class = \"calendar-container\"\n *          ng-model=\"vm.dt\"\n *          calendar-options=\"vm.inlineOptions\"\n *          multiple-selection = \"vm.multipleSelection\"\n *        />\n *     </div>\n *   </file>\n *   <file name=\"rangeCalendarDemo.js\">\n *     angular.module('rangeCalendarDemo', ['easeCalendar'])\n *       .controller('RangeCalendarCtrl', function($scope) {\n *          var vm = this\n *          this.dt = this.dt = null\n *          moment.locale('en')\n *          this.inlineOptions = {\n *            format_day_title: \"MMMM, YYYY\",\n *            min_date: new Date('01/01/2016'),\n *            max_date: new Date('12/12/2016')\n *          }\n *          this.multipleSelection = []\n *          this.startDate = null\n *          this.endDate = null\n *\n *          $scope.$watchCollection('vm.multipleSelection', function(newValue) {\n *            if(newValue.length > 1) {\n *              vm.startDate = new Date(newValue[0])\n *              vm.endDate = new Date(newValue[1])\n *            }\n *          })\n *        })\n *   </file>\n * </example>\n *\n */\n/* @ngInject */\nexport default ($provide, $injector) => {\n    const easeCalendarDelegate = ($delegate) => {\n        let directive = $delegate[0];\n        directive.compile = () => {\n            return (scope, element, attrs, ctrls) => {\n                if (!attrs.multipleSelection)\n                    return;\n                let calendarCtrl = ctrls[0];\n                let ngModelCtrl = ctrls[1];\n                calendarCtrl.selectedDates = [];\n                scope.$parent.$watchCollection(attrs.multipleSelection, (newVal) => {\n                    calendarCtrl.selectedDates = newVal;\n                });\n                ngModelCtrl.$viewChangeListeners.push(() => {\n                    let newVal = scope.$parent.$eval(attrs.ngModel);\n                    let dateVal = newVal.getTime();\n                    let selectedDates = calendarCtrl.selectedDates;\n                    if (!selectedDates.length || selectedDates.length > 1) {\n                        return selectedDates.splice(0, selectedDates.length, dateVal);\n                    }\n                    selectedDates.push(dateVal);\n                    let tempVal = Math.min.apply(null, selectedDates);\n                    let maxVal = Math.max.apply(null, selectedDates);\n                    tempVal = new Date(tempVal).setHours(24);\n                    while (tempVal < maxVal) {\n                        selectedDates.push(tempVal);\n                        tempVal = new Date(tempVal).setHours(24);\n                    }\n                });\n                scope.$watch(() => calendarCtrl.activeDate.getTime(), update);\n                // [FIXME] [SD] This is as bad as it gets...\n                scope.$watch(() => calendarCtrl.selectedDay, update);\n                scope.$watch(calendarCtrl.selectedDates, update);\n                function buildDayObject(current, start, day, end) {\n                    const isStaticContent = angular.isUndefined(calendarCtrl.staticContent);\n                    const startDayLabel = isStaticContent ?

The\n  primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n  registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the reason\n  why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\n  Terminology\n  -----------\n\n  - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n  - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n  - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n  - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n  - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n  - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n\n  A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n\n  Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n  state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n  rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n\n  Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n  promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n  settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n  itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n  itself fulfill.\n\n\n  Basic Usage:\n  ------------\n\n  ```js\n  let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n    // on success\n    resolve(value);\n\n    // on failure\n    reject(reason);\n  });\n\n  promise.then(function(value) {\n    // on fulfillment\n  }, function(reason) {\n    // on rejection\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Advanced Usage:\n  ---------------\n\n  Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n  `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n\n  ```js\n  function getJSON(url) {\n    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n      let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\n      xhr.open('GET', url);\n      xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n      xhr.responseType = 'json';\n      xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n      xhr.send();\n\n      function handler() {\n        if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n          if (this.status === 200) {\n            resolve(this.response);\n          } else {\n            reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n          }\n        }\n      };\n    });\n  }\n\n  getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n    // on fulfillment\n  }, function(reason) {\n    // on rejection\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n\n  ```js\n  Promise.all([\n    getJSON('/posts'),\n    getJSON('/comments')\n  ]).then(function(values){\n    values[0] // => postsJSON\n    values[1] // => commentsJSON\n\n    return values;\n  });\n  ```\n\n  @class Promise\n  @param {function} resolver\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @constructor\n*/\nfunction Promise(resolver) {\n  this[PROMISE_ID] = nextId();\n  this._result = this._state = undefined;\n  this._subscribers = [];\n\n  if (noop !== resolver) {\n    typeof resolver !== 'function' && needsResolver();\n    this instanceof Promise ? initializePromise(this, resolver) : needsNew();\n  }\n}\n\nPromise.all = all;\nPromise.race = race;\nPromise.resolve = resolve;\nPromise.reject = reject;\nPromise._setScheduler = setScheduler;\nPromise._setAsap = setAsap;\nPromise._asap = asap;\n\nPromise.prototype = {\n  constructor: Promise,\n\n  /**\n    The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n    which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n    reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n  \n    ```js\n    findUser().then(function(user){\n      // user is available\n    }, function(reason){\n      // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Chaining\n    --------\n  \n    The return value of `then` is itself a promise.  This second, 'downstream'\n    promise is resolved with the return value of the first promise's fulfillment\n    or rejection handler, or rejected if the handler throws an exception.\n  \n    ```js\n    findUser().then(function (user) {\n      return user.name;\n    }, function (reason) {\n      return 'default name';\n    }).then(function (userName) {\n      // If `findUser` fulfilled, `userName` will be the user's name, otherwise it\n      // will be `'default name'`\n    });\n  \n    findUser().then(function (user) {\n      throw new Error('Found user, but still unhappy');\n    }, function (reason) {\n      throw new Error('`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy');\n    }).then(function (value) {\n      // never reached\n    }, function (reason) {\n      // if `findUser` fulfilled, `reason` will be 'Found user, but still unhappy'.\n      // If `findUser` rejected, `reason` will be '`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy'.\n    });\n    ```\n    If the downstream promise does not specify a rejection handler, rejection reasons will be propagated further downstream.\n  \n    ```js\n    findUser().then(function (user) {\n      throw new PedagogicalException('Upstream error');\n    }).then(function (value) {\n      // never reached\n    }).then(function (value) {\n      // never reached\n    }, function (reason) {\n      // The `PedgagocialException` is propagated all the way down to here\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Assimilation\n    ------------\n  \n    Sometimes the value you want to propagate to a downstream promise can only be\n    retrieved asynchronously. This can be achieved by returning a promise in the\n    fulfillment or rejection handler. The downstream promise will then be pending\n    until the returned promise is settled. This is called *assimilation*.\n  \n    ```js\n    findUser().then(function (user) {\n      return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n    }).then(function (comments) {\n      // The user's comments are now available\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    If the assimliated promise rejects, then the downstream promise will also reject.\n  \n    ```js\n    findUser().then(function (user) {\n      return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n    }).then(function (comments) {\n      // If `findCommentsByAuthor` fulfills, we'll have the value here\n    }, function (reason) {\n      // If `findCommentsByAuthor` rejects, we'll have the reason here\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Simple Example\n    --------------\n  \n    Synchronous Example\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let result;\n  \n    try {\n      result = findResult();\n      // success\n    } catch(reason) {\n      // failure\n    }\n    ```\n  \n    Errback Example\n  \n    ```js\n    findResult(function(result, err){\n      if (err) {\n        // failure\n      } else {\n        // success\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Promise Example;\n  \n    ```javascript\n    findResult().then(function(result){\n      // success\n    }, function(reason){\n      // failure\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Advanced Example\n    --------------\n  \n    Synchronous Example\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let author, books;\n  \n    try {\n      author = findAuthor();\n      books  = findBooksByAuthor(author);\n      // success\n    } catch(reason) {\n      // failure\n    }\n    ```\n  \n    Errback Example\n  \n    ```js\n  \n    function foundBooks(books) {\n  \n    }\n  \n    function failure(reason) {\n  \n    }\n  \n    findAuthor(function(author, err){\n      if (err) {\n        failure(err);\n        // failure\n      } else {\n        try {\n          findBoooksByAuthor(author, function(books, err) {\n            if (err) {\n              failure(err);\n            } else {\n              try {\n                foundBooks(books);\n              } catch(reason) {\n                failure(reason);\n              }\n            }\n          });\n        } catch(error) {\n          failure(err);\n        }\n        // success\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Promise Example;\n  \n    ```javascript\n    findAuthor().\n      then(findBooksByAuthor).\n      then(function(books){\n        // found books\n    }).catch(function(reason){\n      // something went wrong\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    @method then\n    @param {Function} onFulfilled\n    @param {Function} onRejected\n    Useful for tooling.\n    @return {Promise}\n  */\n  then: then,\n\n  /**\n    `catch` is simply sugar for `then(undefined, onRejection)` which makes it the same\n    as the catch block of a try/catch statement.\n  \n    ```js\n    function findAuthor(){\n      throw new Error('couldn't find that author');\n    }\n  \n    // synchronous\n    try {\n      findAuthor();\n    } catch(reason) {\n      // something went wrong\n    }\n  \n    // async with promises\n    findAuthor().catch(function(reason){\n      // something went wrong\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    @method catch\n    @param {Function} onRejection\n    Useful for tooling.\n    @return {Promise}\n  */\n  'catch': function _catch(onRejection) {\n    return this.then(null, onRejection);\n  }\n};\n\nfunction polyfill() {\n    var local = undefined;\n\n    if (typeof global !== 'undefined') {\n        local = global;\n    } else if (typeof self !== 'undefined') {\n        local = self;\n    } else {\n        try {\n            local = Function('return this')();\n        } catch (e) {\n            throw new Error('polyfill failed because global object is unavailable in this environment');\n        }\n    }\n\n    var P = local.Promise;\n\n    if (P) {\n        var promiseToString = null;\n        try {\n            promiseToString = Object.prototype.toString.call(P.resolve());\n        } catch (e) {\n            // silently ignored\n        }\n\n        if (promiseToString === '[object Promise]' && !P.cast) {\n            return;\n        }\n    }\n\n    local.Promise = Promise;\n}\n\npolyfill();\n// Strange compat..\nPromise.polyfill = polyfill;\nPromise.Promise = Promise;\n\nreturn Promise;\n\n})));\n//# sourceMappingURL=es6-promise.map\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ../~/es6-promise/dist/es6-promise.js\n// module id = 64\n// module chunks = 0","// shim for using process in browser\nvar process = module.exports = {};\n\n// cached from whatever global is present so that test runners that stub it\n// don't break things.

 * @name easeUiModal\n  * @module easeUIModal\n  *\n  * @description\n  * Component that, together with easeUIModalService, allows the consumer to create and use a fully functional modal. The modal\n  * takes in a method to close the modal (closeModal), an ID for the modal close button (modalId), a string to display as the title in the\n  * modal (modalTitle), and optional parameters that determine the role of the modal for accessibility tools (modalRole, default is dialog),\n  * if the modal should be double wide (doubleWide, default is false), if the modal should be full screen in desktop view (fullScreen,\n  * default is false), and if the modal icon circle should be shown in the mobile view (showIconMobile, default is false). The modal\n  * service uses promises for the modal, allowing the consumer to pass data from the modal to the page it was loaded on, as well as\n  * pass data into the modal. The steps to set up and use the modal component are as follows:\n  *\n  * 1.) Add 'easeUIModalService' as a dependency to the controller for the page where the modal will be used.\n  *\n  * 2.) In the method that will open the modal, use the easeUIModalService.showModal method. Pass an object containing the name of\n  * the controller to use in the modal (controller) and the path to the HTML file for the modal (templateUrl) as the parameter for the\n  * showModal method. If a controller is not passed in, the modal will use the default controller provided in easeUIModalService, which\n  * contains only the close() method. If you need to pass data into the modal, you can include an object with the data defined (inputs).\n  * Lastly, you must make sure to include the resolution for the promise (see usage code for reference).\n  *\n  * 3.) In the controller for the modal, add 'close' as a dependency. You must include $scope.close = close in the controller in order\n  * for the modal to close correctly. If data needs to be passed back, it can be included in a result object that is then used\n  * as a parameter in the close function (i.e. close($scope.result)). If data has been passed in using the inputs object, you will have\n  * to add the name of the input as a dependency in the modal controller in order to reference it. For an example where data is being\n  * passed to and from modals, please see the code for the results and confirm modals below.\n  *\n  * 4.) In the HTML file for the modal, wrap the desired contents of the modal inside the <ease-ui-modal> tag, with the required\n  * inputs.\n  *\n  * @usage\n  * ```html\n  * <ease-ui-modal close-modal=\"close()\" modal-id=\"'modalExample'\" modal-title=\"'Your Modal Title'\">\n  *   Your modal content here\n  * </ease-ui-modal>\n  * ```\n  * ```js\n  * easeUIModalService.showModal({\n  *   templateUrl: 'path/to/file.html',\n  *   controller: controllerForModal\n  * }).then(function(modal) {\n  *   modal.close.then(function(result) {\n  *     // code to handle result object\n  *   })\n  * })\n  * ```\n  *\n  * @param {function} closeModal Function that triggers when user closes the modal.\n  * @param {string} modalId ID value for modal close button. It will be appended to 'closeModal_' (i.e. closeModal_modalExample).\n  * @param {string} modalTitle Title to display above the modal content.\n  * @param {string} [loopTarget=\".ease-modal-close-button\"] CSS selector string for override element to be targeted when looping through the modal.\n  * @param {string} [modalRole=dialog] Set the role of the modal to use for accessibility tools.\n  * @param {boolean} [doubleWide=false] Determines if modal should be shown as double width on desktop view.\n  * @param {boolean} [fullScreen=false] Determines if modal should be full screen on desktop view.\n  * @param {boolean} [showIconMobile=false] Determines if icon should be shown in mobile view.\n  *\n  * @example\n  * <example name=\"modal\"

Toggle the dropdown menu.\n * 2. Display the last selected option.\n * 3. Filter from the dropdown menu list.\n * 4. Ability to choose data-point for filter.\n * 5. Set default select value.\n * 6. Enable or disable the ease-ui-dropdown-menu list filter.\n * 7. Supports all the combobox key-navigation funcations.\n *\n *\n * Accessibility requirement:\n *\n * Please give role=\"application\" to the immediate parent tag of <ease-ui-dropdown> for JAWs to work properly\n *\n *\n * FAQ\n *\n * Q: Which attribute should I use to pass the data to the ease-ui-dropdown component?\n * A: Persist-items attribute should be used for passing data to the ease-ui-dropdown component.\n *\n * Q: Do I need to use the ease-ui-dropdown-menu component in ease-ui-dropdown?\n * A: Yes, ease-ui-dropdown-menu renders all the list items.\n *\n * Q: Do I need to supply items array to ease-ui-dropdown component?\n * A: No. Ease-ui-dropdown will internally generate items array from persist-items.  However, the consumer must provide\n *    one controller variable to synchronize the three places (vm.items) in the sample code of the below Usage part.\n *\n * Q: Why do you need is-open? Is is required all the time?\n * A: This attribute will bind the toggle feature for the dropdown menu. Absolutely required.\n *\n * Q: Why do you have data-index `{`{$index}`}`?\n * A: Interesting question. It is required to provide the index to track the click event for li element.\n *\n * Q: what is role = \"option\" doing in example with template?\n * A: It makes your template accessible.\n *\n * Q: How do I set the preselect value?\n * A: Predefining the model-value, secondary-data and tertiary-data attribute will set the preselect value for the input field.\n *\n * Q: Why does drop-down not render my updated array items?\n * A: Array should be contained in object. eg.: list = {items:[{},{},{}]}\n *\n * Q: Why do I see one critical aXe scan defect: Required ARIA child role not present: textbox\n * A: This is an known open issue with the aXe tool and we already talk with accessibility team.

ease-ui-dropdonw-menu.\n * Out of the box this component will provide following features:\n *\n * 1. Toggle the dropdown menu.\n * 2. Display the last selected option.\n * 3. Filter from the dropdown menu list.\n * 4. Ability to choose data-point for filter.\n * 5. Set default select value.\n * 6. Enable or disable the ease-ui-dropdown-menu list filter.\n * 7. For accessibility use case. Pressing 'Return Key' Will toggle the dropdown menu.\n *\n * FAQ\n *\n * Q: Do I need to use the ease-ui-dropdown-menu component in ease-ui-dropdonw-input?\\n\n * A: Yes, ease-ui-dropdown-input handles the toggle feature for the ease-ui-dropdown-menu. It also has the dependencies for the dropdown filter.\n *\n * Q: Do I need to supply items to ease-ui-dropdown input, menu and template?\n * A: Yes, It is required for the dropdown filter. No, if you have template set to true.\n *\n * Q: Why do you need is-open? Is is required all the time?\n * A: This attribute will bind the toggle feature for the dropdown menu. Absolutely required.\n *\n * Q: Why do you have data-index `{`{$index}`}`?\n * A: Interesting question. It is required to provide the index track the click event for li element.\n *\n * Q: what is role = \"menuitem\" doing in example with template?\n * A: It makes your template accessible.\n *\n * Q: How do I set the preselect value?\n * A: Predefining the primary-data and secondary-data attribute will set the preselect value for the input field.\n *\n * Q: Why does drop-down not render my updated array items?\n * A: Array should be contained in object. eg.: list = {items:[{},{},{}]}\n *\n *\n *\n * @usage\n * Note: Ignore ` symbols in angular expression.\n * ```html\n *  <ease-ui-dropdown-input\n *          place-holder = \"`{`{vm.title}`}`\"\n *          is-open = \"vm.isOpen\"\n *          items = \"vm.items\"\n *          model-value = \"vm.selectedItem\"\n *          filter-key = \"label\"\n *          id= \"search-amount\"\n *          title =\"Amount\"\n *          sub-title = \"`{`{vm.selectedAmount}`}`\"\n *          required = vm.required\n *          error-message = \"You must select an amount\"\n *          primary-data = \"`{`{vm.primaryData}`}`\"\n *          secondary-data= \"`{`{vm.secondaryData}`}`\"\n *          disable-search = true\n *        >\n *        <ease-ui-dropdown-menu\n *            select=\"vm.selected(item)\"\n *            items=\"vm.items\"\n *            template = true\n *            is-open = \"vm.isOpen\"\n *            component-id = \"example\"\n *          >\n *          <li data-ng-repeat = \"item in vm.items\"\n *              data-index = `{`{$index}`}`\n *              role = \"menuitem\"\n *              tabindex=\"0\"\n *            >\n *              <span tabindex = \"-1\" class=\"ease-itemlabel\">{{item.label}}</span>\n *              <span tabindex = \"-1\" class=\"ease-itemSubLabel\">{{item.subLabel}}</span>\n *              <span tabindex = \"-1\" class=\"ease-item-amount\">{{item.amount}}</span>\n *            </li>\n *          </ease-ui-dropdown-menu>\n *   </ease-ui-dropdown-input\n *\n * ```\n *\n * @param {String} place-holder This text is the place holder for the input field.\n * @param {Boolean} is-open This controls show/hide dropdown.\n * @param {Array} items List of objects/string for data filtration.\n * @param {String} model-value This variable holds ng-model value (consider as ng-model).\n * @param {String} filter-key This is the object property name for multi data-point list.

'./easeExtensibilityBar.component';\n/**\n * @ngdoc module\n * @name easeExtensibilityBar\n * @module easeExtensibilityBar\n * @description\n * easeExtensibilityBar is a fully data driven component which draws extensibility bar based on user's input data. As of\n * now extensiblityBar can display four main menus on it. On tab, extensiblityBar will show menus 1,2 and 4. On Mobile device\n * extensibility bar will show  menu 4 or compressed menus 1,3,4 depending on 'mobile-column' flag and on desktop view all 4\n * options will be avilabel.\n * One can as well pass more than four menus to the extensibility bar and mark them invisible by using\n * ng-show attribute. Pleaes refer to example below for more information.\n *\n * easeExtensibilityBar component can as well render more account services in modal, if data for it is provided. This data will\n * be displayed in 3 by n matrix by default. 'menu-attrs' attribute allows to pass valid html\n * tags to the component including angular specific once like ng-show, ng-class etc. Please refer\n * to below example for more details.\n * If out of the box implementation for more account services is not desired,\n * user can provide custom template through 'modal-template-url' attributeto of the directive which will get rendered inside modal.\n * This template will have the same scope as that of the modal-controller.\n *\n * FAQ\n *\n *\n * How can I address tleaf requirments ?\n *\n * to set id or any other attribute , just pass it on in attrs array as  {key: 'id', val:'someValue'}.\n *\n * =============================================================\n *\n * How sitecatalyst requirments are being addressed ?\n *\n * you can pass in the following: ```{key:'ng-click', val: 'vm.doSomething()'}``` in the list of attributes.\n *\n * =============================================================\n *\n * How can I address accessibility requirments?\n *\n * you can pass in custom properties through attrs array and those will get applied to the element. e.g. {key: 'aria-label', val:'someValue'}\n *\n * =============================================================\n *\n * How to have multi column rendering for mobile view ?\n *\n * Provide appropriate value for attribute mobile-columns. Value 1 will render one column layout, value 3 will render 3 column layout for mobile.\n *\n * =============================================================\n *\n *  What if I want to have different layout for more account services ?\n *\n * By default more account services will display 3 by 3 matrix to display all menus. If you wish to have\n * custom layout, you can provide custom html through attribute \"modalTemplateUrl\" which will get rendered\n * inside modal.\n *\n * =============================================================\n *\n * @usage\n * ```html\n *<ease-extensibility-bar content=\"::json\" modal-controller=\"modalController\"  mobile-columns = 3></ease-extensibility-bar>\n * ```\n *\n * @param {string} modal-controller Name of the controller for handling modal interactions .\n * @param {number} mobile-columns Number of columns for mobile view (1 or 3) .\n * @param {string} modalTemplateUrl template URL for modal incase \"More Account Services\"layout needs to be overridden .\n * @param {string} modal-title Title for  \"More Account Services\" modal .\n * @param {function} open-modal-call-back Optional callback for more services modal.

The consumer also\n * has the option to set the input box type to phone, email, or date (inputType). The consumer can also pass in a maximum character\n * limit (charLimit), the length, in characters, of the input box (length), a method to validate the content of the input box\n * (validateInput), and other parameters (see below documentation for more details). All the date error message should follow this object signature static-content = {dateValidationMsg: {invalidDate: '', invalidMaxDate:'', invalidMinDate:''}}\n * to prevent from crowding the component with attributes.\n *\n * FAQ\n *\n * Q: Why is icon in ease-input field not aligned right inside the input field and will it occur on EASE App after consumption?\n *\n * A: There is an inconsistency on the occurrence of this issue and it is only occurring on build book example.\n *    This issue wasn’t reproducible in EASE App during consumption testing. Development team is doing root cause analysis for this issue and will release a hot-fix based on the solution.\n *    In order to get the quickest help, please email #Houston directly.\n *\n * Q: Why does the error message not read out when using the JAWS screen reader?\n *\n * A: According to the Accessibility team, there is an issue with JAWS that prevents the error message from being announced\n *    to the user. As a result, we have added the aria-describedby attribute so that any present error message will be read out\n *    when the user is focused on the input field (as part of the description of the field).\n *\n * Language Support\n *\n * Please note this section is only required for EASE consumers: all other consumers are not required to pass the\n * staticContent object (though they are welcome to use it to pass customized content to the component).\n * If the object is not passed, the component will fall back to default English content.\n *\n * The input component has been built to handle receiving static content from Nuxeo, in order to support multiple languages.\n * This is done via the staticContent parameter, which contains the placeholder, validationMsg, and maxCharMsg keys. These keys\n * should have the static content values fetched from Nuxeo. Currently, the available files are in Nuxeo under the EASE/CORE folder,\n * and are named 'core_component_forminputs_en_US.properties' (English) and 'core_component_forminputs_es_US.properties' (Spanish).\n * It is the consumer's responsibility to pass the correct content, as the component will simply display whatever is passed in the\n * staticContent object.\n *\n * @usage\n * ```html\n * <ease-input static-content=\"contentObj\" input-id=\"'yourId'\" input-val=\"yourVariable\" label=\"'Label Text'\"\n *  input-type=\"'inputType'\" input-status=\"'status'\" char-limit=\"25\" size=\"25\" validate-input=\"validateMethod(content)\"></ease-input>\n * ```\n *\n * @param {object} staticContent A JSON object containing the placeholder, validationMsg, dateValidationMsg and maxCharMsg properties (obtained from Nuxeo or customized). If no object is provided, the default English content from Nuxeo will be used. Please see the Language Support section above for more information.\n * @param {string} inputId The id value used to identify the input box. Note that this must be unique for the page where the component is being consumed.\n * @param {variable} inputVal The variable that will be used to store the contents of the input box. If you use the phone, please provide the initial value in this format (xxx) xxx-xxxx\n * @param {string} label The text label to be displayed above the input box.\n * @param {string} [placeholder=''] String to display if nothing has been entered in the input box. By default, nothing is displayed. For Date please provide MM/DD/YYYY or DD/MM/YYYY. It will be use for date validation and date conversion. NOTE: THIS PARAMETER IS DEPRECATED, PLEASE PASS THIS PARAMETER INSIDE OF THE staticContent OBJECT.\n * @param {string} [validationMsg=''] The customized error message to display to the user if the validation of the input fails. Date object signature {invalidDate: '', invalidMaxDate:'', invalidMinDate:''}. NOTE: THIS PARAMETER IS DEPRECATED, PLEASE PASS THIS PARAMETER INSIDE OF THE staticContent OBJECT.\n * @param {string} [maxCharMsg=''] Message to display when input reaches maximum character limit. NOTE: THIS PARAMETER IS DEPRECATED, PLEASE PASS THIS PARAMETER INSIDE OF THE staticContent OBJECT.\n * @param {integer} [charLimit=null] Max number of characters the user is allowed to enter in the input box. By default, there is no character limit.\n * @param {integer} [length=24] Length of input box, in number of characters.\n * @param {function} [validateInput=return true] The validation method that is run when the user leaves the input box. The method should take in the content of the input box as a parameter, and return true or false if the content passes or fails validation, respectively. By default, there is no validation on the content.\n * @param {string} [inputType=''] Input box type, current options are 'phone', 'email', 'date', or ''. Passing '' or not passing a value will result in a generic input box.\n * @param {string} [inputStatus=''] Input box status, locked or primary.\n * @param {Boolean} [isRequired='false'] This property sets the input to be required.\n * @param {string} [requiredMsg=''] The customized error message for when a required field is left empty after being touched.\n * @param {string} [errorStatus=''] External error status set by the user, value could be 'error' or ''. Consumer can pass in the status value to the input box to force error state.\n * @param {Boolean} [hasError='false'] Input error status. Consumer can watch this value to track the state of the input.\n * @param {string} [errorMsg=''] Input box error status message, consumer pass in the error message.\n * @param {string} [max=''] Input date max-date for validation (attribute needed if date validation is required).\n * @param {string} [min=''] Input date min-date for validation (attribute needed if date validation is required).\n * @param {string} [dateInfo='Today'] extra info for the date if its Today.\n * @param {function} [iconClick=''] Input date callback function for calendar click event.\n * @param {Boolean} [showIcon='false'] Input date show/hide calander icon. True will show the calander popup icon.\n *\n *\n * @example\n * <example name=\"ease-input\" module=\"easeInputExample\">\n *   <file name=\"index.html\">\n *     <div

easeTooltipComponent from './easeTooltip.component';\n/**\n * @ngdoc module\n * @name easeTooltip\n * @module easeTooltip\n * @description\n * Shows a tooltip when inserted into the UI. The tooltip message displayed to the user is controlled by what is passed into the 'tipMessage' variable (the only required param).\n *\n * Additional attributes can be passed in an options object, like triggerMessage, position, positionAuto, size, and showIcon.\n *\n * You can also pass in custom attrs as an array of {key: 'attr', value: 'attrValue'} pairs.\n *\n * Additional details on parameters are detailed below.\n *\n * FAQ:\n * -----------\n * How does the positioning work?\n *\n * Position can be passed in as a string or an object. In conjunction with positionAuto, there are 4 possibilities:\n *\n * (1) position: string && positionAuto: false - tooltip is statically at that position\n *\n * (2) position: object && positionAuto: false - tooltip is statically at each position defined in the position object per breakpoint key. The allowed keys are 'desktop', 'tablet', and 'phone'.\n *\n * For example, given a position object {desktop: 'right', tablet: 'top', phone: 'bottom'}, the tooltip will show to the right at desktop breakpoint, top on tablet, and bottom on phone.\n *\n * If a given breakpoint is not defined (i.e. if 'phone' were missing in the example), the tooltip will use the default position ('top') at that breakpoint.\n *\n * (3) position: string && positionAuto: true - tooltip will test if the given position is visible in the current viewport and if so, will use that position. If not, will try alternate positions as described below.\n *\n * (4) position: object && positionAuto: true - positionAuto isn't meant to be used with a position object. In this case tooltip will convert position to a string equal to the first position value in the object, and then revert to case (3).\n *\n * =============================================================\n *\n * How does positionAuto work?\n *\n * positionAuto tries the given position, and then tries alternate positions in this order:\n *\n * (1) If tooltip's primary position is along the 'top' or 'bottom':\n *\n * [position], [position]-left, [position]-right, [opposite side], [opposite site]-left, [opposite side]-right, left, left-top, left-bottom, right, right-top, right-bottom\n *\n * (2) If tooltip's primary position is along the 'left' or 'right':\n *\n * [position], [position]-top, [position]-bottom, [opposite side], [opposite site]-top, [opposite side]-bottom, top, top-left, top-right, bottom, bottom-left, bottom-right\n *\n * After trying all positions, if it still hasn't found 1 that is visible in the current viewport, it will just display the tooltip at the given position.\n *\n * =============================================================\n *\n * Can showIcon be false and triggerMessage be empty at the same time?\n *\n * Technically yes, but then the user won't have anything to hover/click on so doesn't seem advisable. However the tooltip will still appear in the tab order.\n *\n * =============================================================\n *\n * How does behavior differ between desktop and tablet/phone?\n *\n * On desktop, tooltip visibility is triggered by hover and tab. On tablet/phone, it is triggered on tap. Tapping multiple times toggles visibility; tapping away hides the tooltip as well.\n *\n * =============================================================\n *\n * Can I have a link in the tooltip?\n *\n * That's inadvisable as right now elements in the tooltip would not be keyboard-only accessible (through tabbing). If you choose to implement this, you are in charge of making the content properly accessible.\n *\n * =============================================================\n *\n * Can I pass in a custom ID/function/etc (i.e. for TeaLeaf or SiteCatalyst)?\n *\n * Yes, custom attributes are supported. See the \"custom attributes\" example below.\n *\n * =============================================================\n *\n * @usage\n * ```html\n * // default options: would generate an info icon that has the message on hover\n * <ease-tooltip tip-message=\"'Your tooltip message goes here'\">\n * </ease-tooltip>\n * ```\n *\n * @param {string} tipMessage Message to be displayed in the tooltip. Can contain code.\n * @param {object} [options={attrs: (empty array), position: top, positionAuto: false, size: 'large', showIcon: true, triggerMessage: ''}] Options hash with several expected values. More details on each below.\n * @param {array} [options.attrs=(empty array)] Attrs is an array catch-all for other attributes (formatted as {key: 'attr', value: 'attrValue'}) you want to pass in, which will get attached to a container div.\n * @param {string/object} [options.position='top'] Can be a string or an object. Available positions are: 'top', 'top-left', 'top-right', 'left', 'left-top', 'left-bottom', 'bottom', 'bottom-left', 'bottom-right', 'right', 'right-top', 'right-bottom'. If an object, can pass in up to 3 positions in {breakpoint: position} format. More info in the FAQ.\n * @param {boolean} [options.positionAuto=false] If true, tests if the stated position (if position object passed in, just uses the first position value) is in the viewport, otherwise tries alternate positions, in an order detailed in the FAQ.\n * @param {string} [options.size='large'] Size modifiers for the tooltip. 'large' is 300px, 'medium' is 200px, and 'small' is 100px.\n * @param {boolean} [options.showIcon=true] If true, shows the info icon and anchors the tooltip carat to it. If false, doesn't show the icon and centers the carat on the triggerMessage.\n * @param {string} [options.triggerMessage=''] Text on the page that will also display the tooltip on hover (or click on mobile/tablet). Can contain code.\n *\n * @example\n * <example name=\"easeTooltip\" module=\"easeTooltipDemo\">\n *   <file name=\"index.html\">\n *     <div class=\"wrapper\" ng-controller=\"easeTooltipDemoCtrl as

The component accepts an array containing objects for each filter category (categories) and a\n * JSON object containing the static content (filterLabel, filterCaption) for the component that has either been fetched\n * from Nuxeo or is customized by the consumer (staticContent).\n *\n * Language Support\n *\n * Please note this section is only required for EASE consumers: all other consumers are not required to pass the\n * staticContent object (though they are welcome to use it to pass customized content to the component).\n * If the object is not passed, the component will fall back to default English content.\n *\n * The filterBar component has been built to handle receiving static content from Nuxeo, in order to support multiple languages.\n * This is done via the staticContent parameter, which contains the filterLabel and filterCaption keys. These keys should have\n * the static content values fetched from Nuxeo. Currently, the available files are in Nuxeo under the EASE/CORE folder, and\n * are named 'core_component_transactionfilter_en_US.properties' (English) and 'core_component_transactionfilter_es_US.properties' (Spanish).\n * It is the consumer's responsibility to pass the correct content, as the component will simply display whatever is passed in the\n * staticContent object.\n *\n * @usage\n * ```html\n *  <ease-filter-bar categories = \"vm.categories\" static-content=\"vm.contentObj\">\n *      <search-box></search-box>\n *  </ease-filter-bar>\n * ```\n * When user selects an item from the category flyout, action associated with\n * the object will be fired. You will need to fire 'category-selected' event\n * when user is done selecting the category item.\n * ```js\n * // Event structure\n * new CustomEvent('category-selected', {\n *\n *   detail: {value: 'Statement Picker', index: 1}\n * })\n * // Index points to index of the item being interacted with in your categories array you are passing.\n * document.dispatchEvent(event)\n * ```\n * Also component fires reseting-category-filter when user resets or hits on cancel icon. detail object will contain\n * value indicating which filter was being reset and you can act accordingly based on the value.\n * ```js\n * // Event structure\n * new CustomEvent('reseting-category-filter', {\n *   detail: {\n *     value, index\n *   }\n * })\n * ```\n *\n * This component will accept an array of your filter categories.\n * Object should have following properties.\n * @param {String} key This will be used to identify the object independently\n * @param {String} value The value you want to render in the DOM. E.g Custom Date\n * @param {Array} options This array contains Option object with following properties\n * @param {String} key This will be used to uniquely identify flyout list item.\n * @param {String} value This will be used to render the lable on the DOM.\n * @param {Function} action This function will be invoked on click of this particular property. Say you want to\n * open a Date Range picker or Statement Picker.\n *\n * @example\n * <example name=\"ease-filter-bar\" module=\"easeFilterBarExample\">\n *   <file name=\"index.html\">\n *     <div
